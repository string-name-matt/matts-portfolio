  enrollment app, underpinned by over 15 Google Cloud Functions (Node.js) to automate complex
  business logic.
- **Data & API Integration:** Engineered a secure SFTP server pipeline to automatically ingest and
  process nightly eligibility reports, saving the client dozens of hours in manual data entry per
  month.

  subscription payments.
- **Third-Party APIs:** Leveraged the Twilio API for secure SMS/2FA verification and the Hint API to
  fetch and display DPC provider data based on member proximity.

  only to the primary member and not adult dependents.

Developed and shipped a mission-critical internal employee application used daily by 200+ staff at
Courthouse Club Fitness.
